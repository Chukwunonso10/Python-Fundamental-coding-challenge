"""python code to ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not
Name: Chukwunonso
For example,to check if 17 is prime, you only need to check if it's divisible by numbers from 1 to 4 (the square root of 17 is approximately 4.12).
Since 17 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 4, it's considered a prime number.
